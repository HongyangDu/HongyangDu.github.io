title: "Covert Communication for Jammer-aided Multi-Antenna UAV Networks"
excerpt: "We apply covert communication into the joint radar and communication system and propose a joint radar and covert communication (JRCC) system to achieve high spectrum utilization and secure data transmission simultaneously. However, the performance of JRCC is restricted by severe signal propagation environment and hardware devices. Fortunately, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can change the signal propagation smartly to improve the networks performance with low cost. We first overview fundamental concepts of JRCC and RIS and then propose the RIS-aided JRCC system design."

**Abstract**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted a lot of research attention in serving as aerial base stations (BSs). To protect the data privacy without being detected by a warden, we investigate a jammer-aided UAV covert communication system, aiming to maximize the userâ€™s covert rate with optimized transmit and jamming power. By considering the general composite fading and shadowing channel models, we derive the closedform expressions for detection error probability and covert rate. The covert rate maximization problem is formulated as a Nash bargaining game, and the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) is introduced. To solve the NBS, we propose a particle swarm optimization-based power allocation algorithm. The numerical results are presented to verify the theoretical analysis.

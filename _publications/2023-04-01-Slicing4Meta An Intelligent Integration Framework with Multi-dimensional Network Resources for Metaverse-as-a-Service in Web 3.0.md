title: "Slicing4Meta: An Intelligent Integration Framework with Multi-dimensional Network Resources for Metaverse-as-a-Service in Web 3.0"
excerpt: "To provide scalable subscription solutions for Metaverse services, we propose a new concept, named Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS), in which various physical-virtual components and technologies in the Metaverse can be delivered as services. Furthermore, to unify the management and orchestration of MaaS, we propose a novel framework, called Slicing4Meta, to customize Metaverse services by intelligently integrating MaaS models and the associated multi-dimensional resources on the components and technologies."

**Abstract**: As the next-generation Internet paradigm, Web 3.0 encapsulates the expectations of user-centric immersion and interaction experiences in a decentralized manner. Metaverse, a virtual world interacting with the physical world, is becoming one of the most potential technology to push forward with Web 3.0. In the Metaverse, users expect to tailor immersive and interactive experiences by customizing real-time Metaverse services (e.g., augmented/virtual reality and digital twin) in the three-dimensional virtual world. Nevertheless, there are still no unified solutions for the Metaverse services in terms of management and orchestration. It is calling for a continuous evolution of scalable solutions and mobile systems to support Metaverse services, and thus bring Metaverse into reality. In this paper, to provide scalable subscription solutions for Metaverse services, we propose a new concept, named Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS), in which various physical-virtual components and technologies in the Metaverse can be delivered as services. Furthermore, to unify the management and orchestration of MaaS, we propose a novel framework, called Slicing4Meta, to customize Metaverse services by intelligently integrating MaaS models and the associated multi-dimensional resources on the components and technologies. Additionally, we propose the classification for typical Metaverse services based on the quality of experience (QoE) requirements and illustrate how to fulfill the QoE requirements under the Slicing4Meta framework. We then illustrate a virtual traveling study case, in which we examine the relationship between the QoE and the multi-dimensional resources by quantitatively modeling the QoE of Metaverse users. Finally, we discuss some open challenges of Slicing4Meta and propose potential solutions to address the challenges.

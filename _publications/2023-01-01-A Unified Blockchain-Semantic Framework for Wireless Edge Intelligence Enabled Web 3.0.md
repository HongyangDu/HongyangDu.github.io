**Abstract**: Web 3.0 enables user-generated contents and userselected authorities. With decentralized wireless edge computing architectures, Web 3.0 allows users to read, write, and own contents. A core technology that enables Web 3.0 goals is blockchain, which provides security services by recording content in a decentralized and transparent manner. However, the explosion of on-chain recorded contents and the fast-growing number of users cause increasingly unaffordable computing and storage resource consumption. A promising paradigm is to analyze the semantic information of contents that can convey precisely the desired meanings without consuming many resources. In this article, we propose a unified blockchain-semantic ecosystems framework for wireless edge intelligence-enabled Web 3.0. Our framework consists of six key components to exchange semantic demands. We then introduce an Oracle-based proof of semantic mechanism to implement on-chain and off-chain interactions of Web 3.0 ecosystems on semantic verification algorithms while maintaining service security. An adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning-based sharding mechanism on Oracle is designed to improve interaction efficiency, which can facilitate Web 3.0 ecosystems to deal with varied semantic demands. Finally, a case study is presented to show that the proposed framework can dynamically adjust Oracle settings according to varied semantic demands.

I am an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong (HKU). I received Ph.D. degree at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and B.Eng. degree at Beijing Jiaotong University, China. I am now the Principal Investigator (PI) of the <b>Network Intelligence and <font color=green>C</font>omputing <font color=green>E</font>cosystem (NI<font color=green>CE</font>) Lab</b> @ HKU. The [NICE lab](https://hongyangdu.github.io/nice/) focuses on the integration of *Generative AI in Intelligent Networks*. We pursue two complementary directions: *"<font color=green>Network for AI</font> - Unfold Intelligence by Horizontally Scaling It Across the Network"*, and *"<font color=green>AI for Network</font> - Specialize Intelligence by Vertically Optimizing It for Networks and Domain Systems"*. These two directions converge toward a unified goal: *"<font color=green>Ubiquitous Intelligence</font>, where intelligence is woven into every interaction, every environment, and every moment."*


<img src='/images/directions.png' width = "900"><br/>


Toward this goal, we explore:

1. AI for Network:
   - Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
   - Network large AI models
   - Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
   - Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

2. Network for AI:
   - Distributed training and inference of large AI models
   - Connected large language models
   - Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
   - Edge intelligence



>*For potential students and researchers interested in joining our lab: Please refer to [NICE](https://hongyangdu.github.io/nice/) for openings, research opportunities, and application details.*

>*“Life brings many sorrows. Looking back when unhappy won't bring joy.   
>Dreams, however beautiful, are just dreams. Cherish the present, for it's real. Don't waste time in lonely reflection, toast to those who share your path today.”*
>
>*“生活中有很多的不如意，如果一不开心，就寄希望于当初，那你永远不会开心。  
>幻境再美终是梦，珍惜眼前始为真，莫使金樽空对月，举杯幸会有缘人。”*

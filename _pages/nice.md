## Research Directions

Our main research directions include:

1. AI for Network:
   - Generative artificial intelligence and network optimization
   - Reinforcement learning and its applications in computer networking systems
   - AI-enabled semantic communications
   - Human-centric AI for user-centric network design

2. Network for AI:
   - Distributed training and inference of large AI models
   - Next-generation wireless transmission technologies
   - Edge intelligence

## My Support and Expectations
Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with experts from AI, networking systems, human–computer interaction, psychology, and electrical engineering. Our focus is primarily on publishing in top-tier AI conferences and IEEE journals, complemented by practical implementations. Our primary goal is to prepare our students for future academic positions as well as high-impact positions in industry. Here's what we're looking for and what you can expect from this journey:

### 1. What I Offer:
- Resources: Full scholarships covering study and living in Hong Kong, plus access to advanced research facilities.
- Guidance: **Hands-on mentorship with clear direction.** For outstanding students, I also offer adequate freedom and opportunities for growth.
- International Connections: Strong ties with leading researchers and institutions worldwide. I will help you build international academic connections.
- Friendly Environment and Work-Life Balance: Collaborative and supportive lab culture where teamwork and mutual respect are valued. **Say no to 996; embrace sustainable productivity.**

### 2. What I Expect from You:
- Passion for Learning: **Strong self-motivation and ability to quickly learn from new fields.**
- Academic Foundation: Academic background in computer science, AI, electrical engineering, electronic information/communication engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates with bachelor's degrees from <i>985 / QS Top 50 universities</i> or <i>211 / QS Top 80 universities + strong publication records</i> are encouraged due to HKU committee considerations.
- Experience: Relevant research experience and coding ability demonstrated through papers, projects, or competitions.
- Personal Qualities: Responsibility, reliability, and good communication skills.
- Graduation Requirements: There is NO requirement for the number of papers. **Instead, the graduation requirement is for us to work together to help you find a satisfactory job.** Your success marks the completion of our collaborative journey.

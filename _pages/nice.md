### 3. Visiting Students / Research Assistants / Interns

We welcome outstanding students (including qualified PhD students, master and undergraduate students, either online or in-person) to join our lab and participate in cutting-edge research projects. Priority will be given to students who can build long-term collaboration, or those intending to apply for a PhD at HKU with me.

## My Support and Expectations
Our research is highly interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with experts from AI, networking system, human–computer interaction, psychology, and electrical engineering. Our focus is primarily on publishing in top-tier AI conferences and IEEE journals, complemented by practical implementations. Our primary goal is to prepare our students for future academic positions as well as high-impact positions in industry.

### What I Offer:
- Resources: Full scholarships covering study and living in Hong Kong, plus access to advanced research facilities.
- Guidance: Hands-on mentorship with clear direction. For outstanding students, I also offer ample freedom and opportunities for growth.
- International Connections: Strong ties with leading researchers and institutions worldwide. I will help you build international academic connections.
- Friendly Environment and Work-Life Balance: Collaborative and supportive lab culture where teamwork and mutual respect are valued. Say no to 996; embrace sustainable productivity.

### What I Expect from You:
- Strong self-motivation and ability to quickly learn from new fields.
- Academic background in computer science, AI, electrical engineering, electronic information/communication engineering, mathematics, or related fields. Candidates from '985 / QS Top 80 universities' or '211 universities + strong publication records' are especially encouraged due to committee considerations.
- Relevant research experience and coding ability demonstrated through papers, projects, or competitions.
- Responsibility, reliability, and good communication skills.
